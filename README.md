A mock online petition that visitors can sign to make their voice heard on an issue. This was my first experience creating a full stack application using Node.js and Express-Handlebars. Up to this point I had experience purely in front-end coding and it was time to check the world of servers and databases.

Technologies used: 
HTML canvas, 
Cookie Session, 
Csurf, 
Bcrypt, 
Express-Handlebars, 
PostgreSQL, 
node.js, 
Heroku.
